Follow up after above for review and re-assessment. To optimize pain care, we will start patient on mobic (for anti-inflammatory effect), flexeril (for muscle relaxation). Patient was given mental health screeners to assess current symptomology and to determine and monitor change. Results are documented above, and reviewed as follows: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) The PHQ-9 is a nine item self-report questionnaire, which measures depression. The PHQ-9 is used in assisting primary care clinicians in diagnosing depression, as well as selecting and monitoring treatment. It assesses depressive symptoms, providing a severity score to help select and monitor treatment. Patient scored (0-27) on the PHQ-9, out of a max of 27. This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE mood symptoms. General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a seven item self-report questionnaire, which measures the severity of General Anxiety Disorder, but is a gross measure for anxiety symptoms overall. The GAD-7 is used in assisting clinicians in diagnosing anxiety by providing a severity score to help select and monitor treatment. Patient scored (0-21) on the GAD-7, out of a maximum of 21. This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE anxiety symptoms.',

Follow up after above for review and re-assessment. To optimize pain care, we will start patient on mobic (for anti-inflammatory effect), flexeril (for muscle relaxation). Patient was given mental health screeners to assess current symptomology and to determine and monitor change. Results are documented above, and reviewed as follows: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) The PHQ-9 is a nine item self-report questionnaire, which measures depression. The PHQ-9 is used in assisting primary care clinicians in diagnosing depression, as well as selecting and monitoring treatment. It assesses depressive symptoms, providing a severity score to help select and monitor treatment. Patient scored (0-27) on the PHQ-9, out of a max of 27. This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE mood symptoms. General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a seven item self-report questionnaire, which measures the severity of General Anxiety Disorder, but is a gross measure for anxiety symptoms overall. The GAD-7 is used in assisting clinicians in diagnosing anxiety by providing a severity score to help select and monitor treatment. Patient scored (0-21) on the GAD-7, out of a maximum of 21. This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE anxiety symptoms.',
